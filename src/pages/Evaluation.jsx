            Our solution to save Mr Almas is to send nuclear bombs to Mars in
            order to increase greenhouse effect by melting polar ice caps which
            will help to produce more co2 and water to start growing plants
            during photosynthesis. This solution has its own strengths and
            weaknesses. One of the advantages is that our solution has an
            effective and clear explanation about how to use it which shows good
            planning. Also, this solution can provide not only water, but also
            food in the form of plants, o2 produced from plants and increased
            temperature to have normal conditions to live there. However, one of
            the weak sides was that we can not surely say in which location mr
            Almas is and by sending these bombs we can accidentally kill him.
            Also, it can take a long time for this method to work because such
            chemical and biological processes take months and years to happen,
            for example production of CO2 from ice caps or enough water
            vaporization to continue living there. So, we can assume that he
            will not make it for this long and eventually will die. In
            conclusion, we need to improve our errors and uncertainties to make
            this plan work, for example, we can more specifically identify his
            location and somehow speed up these processes.
